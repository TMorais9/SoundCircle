 * It also handles the initial refresh state and periodic refresh calls.

 * @param children - Children components to render when the refresh is not in progress
 * @param refresh - The refresh attribute containing the refresh logic and API callback
 * @param store - The token store that holds the authentication state and methods to update it
 *
 * @returns ReactNode - The rendered component, either the children or the initial refresh component
