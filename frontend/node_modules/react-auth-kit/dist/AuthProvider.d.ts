 * Make sure you wrap your application as well as your

 *
 * AuthProvider should be your Topmost element so that it can work effectively
 * throughout the application.
 *
 * @example
 * ```jsx
 * import AuthProvider from 'react-auth-kit/AuthProvider'
 * import {createAuthStore} from 'react-auth-kit/store'
 * import ReactRouterPlugin from '@auth-kit/react-router/route'
 *
 * const store = createAuthStore()
 *
 * <AuthProvider store={store} router={ReactRouterPlugin} fallbackPath="/login">
 *  <RoutesComponent/>
 * </AuthProvider>
 * ```
